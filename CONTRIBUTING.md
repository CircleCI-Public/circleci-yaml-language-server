### Security disclosure

Security is a top priority for us. If you have encountered a security issue
please responsibly disclose it by following our
[security disclosure](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/security/) document.

# Creating an Issue

Your issue must follow these guidelines for it to be considered:

#### Before submitting

-   Check youâ€™re on the latest version, we may have already fixed your bug!
-   [Search our issue tracker](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-yaml-language-server/issues/search&type=issues)
    for your problem, someone may have already reported it

# Opening a Pull Request

To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
`circleci-yaml-language-server`, commit your changes, and
[open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Your request will be reviewed as soon as possible. You may be asked to make
changes to your submission during the review process.

#### Before submitting

Test your change thoroughly, to do this you can use the VSCode extension in
`editors/vscode` in order to only test the LSP in an extension that would only
run the LSP and nothing else.

To do so, open a VSCode instance at the root of the project, open the
`Run and Debug` tab and run it via the `Run Extension` on the dropdown menu at
the top of the tab.
